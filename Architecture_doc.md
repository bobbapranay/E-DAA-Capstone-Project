# **🤖 E-DAA Technical Architecture Document**

## **1\. Project Overview**

The **Enterprise Data Analyst Agent (E-DAA)** is a highly specialized **sequential multi-agent system** designed to automate the entire Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) workflow. The architecture is built on the Agent Development Kit (**ADK**) framework and focuses on **specialization of labor** to ensure high-quality, reproducible analysis and insightful business reporting.

---

## **2\. Multi-Agent Pipeline and A2A Protocol**

The E-DAA uses four distinct agents operating in a strict, **sequential workflow**. The agents communicate implicitly using the **Session Memory** (our implementation of the **A2A Protocol**) to pass validated, structured data objects (dataframes, JSON reports) rather than unstructured text.

### **Agent Workflow and Accountability**

| \# | Agent Name | Primary Role | Key Output (Saved to Session) | Course Concept Demonstrated |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1** | **Loader Agent** | Reads the file, validates schema, and cleans initial data. | Validated Pandas **DataFrame** (dataframe\_object) | **Tools** (Custom DataLoaderTool) |
| **2** | **EDA Agent** | Performs all statistical and visual analysis. | Comprehensive **JSON Report** (eda\_json\_report) | **Tools** (CodeExecutionTool) |
| **3** | **Insights Agent** | Translates technical findings into a business narrative. | High-Level **Narrative Report** (insights\_narrative) | **Effective Use of Gemini** |
| **4** | **Modeling Agent** | Recommends ML tasks, features, and algorithms. | Final **ML Recommendation** (modeling\_output) | **Sequential Agent** |

## **3\. State Management (Sessions & Memory)**

The system relies entirely on the **InMemorySessionService** (a form of **Session & State Management**) to manage state and context across the pipeline. This ensures a reliable flow of data:

* **Shared Objects:** The **Pandas DataFrame** and the **EDA JSON Report** are stored centrally. This allows any subsequent agent to retrieve the exact, required context without relying on the previous agent's natural language summary.  
* **Context Compaction:** The **EDA Report** is highly detailed. The **Insights Agent** is specifically prompted to ignore most raw numbers and only synthesize the **key anomalies and business patterns**. This prompt-based synthesis acts as a form of **Context Engineering**, which is crucial for efficient LLM processing and token usage.

## **4\. Tool Utilization**

The E-DAA system incorporates the required **Tools** concept via one custom tool and one built-in tool:

### **A. Custom Tool: DataLoaderTool**

* **File:** tools/data\_loader\_tool.py  
* **Function:** Handles secure I/O for file loading (.csv, .xlsx) into a Pandas DataFrame object and immediately stores the DataFrame in the shared session memory.

### **B. Built-in Tool: CodeExecutionTool**

* **File:** tools/code\_execution\_tool.py  
* **Function:** Executes Python code strings generated by the LLM. This is critical for generating **reproducible statistics and visualizations** (EDA Agent) and running feature importance calculations (Modeling Agent).  
* **Concept:** Demonstrates the secure use of the **Code Execution** tool concept, as the code runs in an isolated environment.

## **5\. Observability and Agent Evaluation**

* **Observability (Logging):** The main.py orchestrator incorporates the standard Python logging module to print status messages, track the start/end of each agent's operation, and log success/failure checks, fulfilling the basic **Observability** requirement.  
* **Agent Evaluation (Validation):** The sequential design includes implicit evaluation. In main.py, a simple check is performed after the **Loader Agent** runs: if a valid Pandas DataFrame object is not found in the session memory (dataframe\_object is None), the orchestrator terminates the pipeline and returns an error. This demonstrates a crucial self-checking mechanism for **Agent Evaluation**.
