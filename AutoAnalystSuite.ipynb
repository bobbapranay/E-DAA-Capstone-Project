# AutoAnalystSuite.ipynb Overview

This Jupyter Notebook provides a fully executable demo of the Enterprise Data Analyst Agent. It includes:

- Environment setup with all dependency installs
- Loading sample datasets (e.g., Titanic CSV) and basic data checks
- Implementation of core agents:
  - Loader Agent: Reads and validates dataset
  - EDA Agent: Performs exploratory analysis, computes stats
  - Insights Agent: Generates natural language insights using Gemini
  - Modeling Agent: Suggests modeling plan based on data profile
- Session and memory integration for multi-turn analysis
- Visualization generation with charts saved and displayed inline
- Evaluation pipeline to compare output against baseline metrics
- Simple API endpoint stubs for deployment demonstration
- Markdown explanations documenting each step and agent behavior

The notebook is designed for ease of use on Kaggle or local Jupyter environments and allows users to experiment with the full pipeline interactively.

**How to use:**

1. Install dependencies via `!pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run cells sequentially to load data, run agents, generate insights, and visualize results.
3. Modify queries or datasets inline for instant feedback.
4. Review evaluation outputs for quantitative understanding of agent accuracy and performance.

This notebook serves as both detailed documentation and a runnable showcase of the project’s full capabilities, ideal for sharing, peer review, and rapid prototyping.
