# AutoAnalystSuite.ipynb Overview

This Jupyter Notebook is saved in the `.ipynb` format (Jupyter Notebook format), which is a JSON-based file standard for interactive computational documents. It combines:

- Executable Python code cells
- Rich Markdown narrative and documentation cells
- Inline visualization outputs (plots, charts)
- Data exploration and analysis steps
- Integration with AI agents and tools for data profiling, insight generation, and model recommendation
- Session state management for multi-turn conversational workflows
- Evaluation pipeline displaying quantitative performance metrics
- Optional API endpoint stubs for deployment examples

Jupyter Notebooks in `.ipynb` format are fully supported by Kaggle, GitHub (with rendering of Markdown and outputs), JupyterLab, and VS Code, making them ideal for sharing runnable demonstrations of AI agent projects in data analytics.

**How to save:**
- From Jupyter or JupyterLab UI: `File → Save As → AutoAnalystSuite.ipynb`
- From VS Code: create a new Jupyter Notebook and save as `AutoAnalystSuite.ipynb`
- Programmatically, save notebook content as JSON with `.ipynb` extension

**Compatibility:**
- Versions supported: nbformat 4.x (most up-to-date standard)
- Fully executable on Kaggle (recommended for your submission)
- Rendered seamlessly on GitHub for results visualization

**Summary:**
Use `.ipynb` to encapsulate your full project pipeline, be it data loading, agent execution, visualization, or evaluation—making your work easily runnable, shareable, and reviewable.
